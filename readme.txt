A better management for WordPress Media Library



== Description ==

The plugin will be handy for those who need to manage a lot of media files.


= Media Taxonomies =

**Categories and Tags for media items**

**Various media categories.** With the plugin installed you immediately obtain Media Categories for categorizing and filtering media items in WordPress admin. This feature alone will save you hours of searching through a media library with even as few as 100 images.

Whether you have a lot of images that need to be organized into complex structures or simply dislike the name of the default taxonomy – Media Categories – you can create and (un)assign to the media library as many taxonomies as you wish without writing a single line of code.

You can also assign to the media library built-in WordPress taxonomies – Categories and Tags – as well as any other taxonomy created by third-party plugin, theme, or hand-coded – with only plugin's UI.

**For both new and existing media items.** Categorize both new and existing media items. You can assign a category to a media item during the upload process, in the media library (preferably in the Grid Mode), in post/page editor media popup ("Add Media" button). If you need to manage a lot of media items at once, there is the PRO version of the plugin that allows to do it in bulk.

**Filter media items in WP admin.** Every media library screen is enhanced with the plugin's filters to search and sort your media files. With flexible plugin's options you can adjust what filters you will see in Grid and List modes of the media library and in post/page editor media popups, and what taxonomies you would like to edit when inserting media to posts/pages. The plugin works with custom post types as well. The options can also help you to force plugin's filters for third-party plugins or themes, manage media taxonomies archive pages, etc.

**Order options.** With two options "Order media items by" (Date, Title, and Custom Order) and "Sort order" (Ascending and Descending) you can control media items order for all screens of the media library in WP admin. "Custom Order" allows to re-order media items within a category with drag and drop. This order will be used, in particular, for the gallery based on this category. See `Settings > Media > Media Library`.


= Filter-Based Shortcodes =

**Image Gallery and Audio / Video Playlist**

**Fully compatible with WordPress native shortcodes.** Media items categorizing can be useful for the front-end as well. To insert media galleries or audio / video playlists based on media categories you have to use the familiar format like `[gallery media_category="5" category="2" limit="10" monthnum="12" year="2015" orderby="title" order="DESC"]` or `[playlist media_category="5" category="2" limit="10" monthnum="12" year="2015" orderby="title" order="DESC"]`. The PRO version of the plugin allows to manage gallery or playlist shortcode without "coding" at all. Just choose the settings with the plugin's UI in the familiar edit popup and see your gallery / playlis live immediately in the post/page editor.

To turn on the feature set "Enhanced media shortcodes" option on `Settings > Media > Media Library > Media Shortcodes`. Please be advised that conflicts with other gallery plugins or themes are possible. Check your front-end and back-end gallery / playlist functionality after activating the feature.


= MIME Types =

**Media File Types**

Another feature of the plugin is the MIME Types control. You can add new MIME types, delete existing ones, and point what file types are allowed for uploading. Initially, the plugin shows up the WordPress default MIME Type settings and creates the backup of them. The column "Add Filter" allows to add a MIME Type to plugin's filters so that you will be able to filter your media items not only by categories but also by the file type. You can set any label you wish to see in a filter with columns "Singular Label" and "Plural Label".


= Export / Import Plugin Settings =

If you need to move your media library to another website you should export and import WordPress content with WordPress built-in export/import. But to make the Enhanced Media Library work on the new site with the same settings you are provided with the export/import feature.


= Easy to Use and WordPress Native Functionality Oriented Plugin =

We spend hours to make plugins features work as though they were native WordPress functionality. If you are a developer and looking for a solution totally compatible with WordPress core and, at the same point, really easy to deal with for your non-geeky customers, give it a try, you won't be disappointed.


= Support =

Support is free for both versions of the plugin. "PRO"-users do not have priority. We do out best to respond in 24 hours if not sooner.

= Incompatibility =

Please notice that you use the Enhanced Media Library with other plugins that add media categories, media folders, and manage MIME Types at your own risk. We cannot guarantee their compatibility because of different approach to the same functionality. It does NOT mean that we do not recommend using those plugins, it just means we do not recommend to use them at the same time with the Enhanced Media Library. Please choose the one you prefer.
